NDFrame is parent class of DataFrame.
N-dimensional analogue of DataFrame. Store multi-dimensional in a
    size-mutable, labeled data structure



class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    """ Two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data
    structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations
    align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like
    container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure






loc works on labels in the index.
iloc works on the positions in the index (so it only takes integers).
ix usually tries to behave like loc but falls back to behaving. ix is deprecated in future version.
like iloc if the label is not in the index.
It's important to note some subtleties that can make ix slightly tricky to use:

if the index is of integer type, ix will only use label-based indexing and
not fall back to position-based indexing.
 If the label is not in the index, an error is raised.
if the index does not contain only integers, then given an integer,
ix will immediately use position-based indexing
rather than label-based indexing. If however ix is given another type (e.g. a string),
 it can use label-based indexing.
